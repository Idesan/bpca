One main advantage of the BPCA-based imputation is that it is virtually parameter-free. The dimensionality of the latent space is a critical parameter in any PCA-based algorithm. In `bpca`, it can be automatically determined via an automatic relevance determination mechanism. This feature makes `bpca` a preferred choice when the number of samples is limited.
