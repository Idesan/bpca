The primary goal of this framework is to identify primary aldosteronism patients who could benefit from specific surgical treatment.

## Problem setting 

As the name implies, the proposed framework comprises two modules:
- Data adaptation module,
- Patient classification module.

The key assumption is that it operates in a **multicenter** setting. In other words, it utilizes a well-established reference dataset from one medical institution to build these models and employs a form of *transfer learning* to apply the models to data collected at other medical institutions. The overall problem setting is explained [here](framework_introduction.ipynb). 

## Technical details of the adaptation moddule

For domain adaptation with a limited number of samples, a new algorithm called `bpca_impute` has been developed. This module implements a data imputation approach using Bayesian probabilistic principal component analysis. One significant advantage of our BPCA-based imputation is that it is essentially parameter-free. In `impute_bpca_ard`, the dimensionality of the latent principal subspace, which is the critical parameter in any PCA-based algorithm, is automatically determined through an automatic relevance determination (ARD) mechanism. This feature makes it a preferred choice when dealing with a limited number of samples.
